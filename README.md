### SALib Tutorial - GRA 2020

SALib is a Python library for global sensitivity analysis (https://github.com/SALib/SALib), which determines the relative influence of model input variables on one or more outputs of interest.

**Installation:** `pip install SALib`

The library includes multiple methods. For a good review of sensitivity analysis methods, I suggest this paper:
```
Pianosi, Francesca, et al. "Sensitivity analysis of environmental models: A systematic review with 
practical workflow." Environmental Modelling & Software 79 (2016): 214-232.
```

The tutorial will introduce some theory behind global sensitivity analysis, with a focus on the Sobol method. This will be demonstrated on a simple test function, followed by a discussion of frequently asked questions for interpreting the results.

This tutorial assumes some background in Python programming and statistics, but will be presented at an introductory level.
